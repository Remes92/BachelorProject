# BachelorProject

A bachelor thesis project done at University of Sk√∂vde by Pontus Erlandsson and Joakim Remes.
Project involves comparing reponse performance of GraphQL, RESTful and SOAP. This repository contains
the c# code for the API's and the backend. 
The soap API with a copy of backend exists [here](https://github.com/Remes92/BachelorProjectSOAP), Client to test and log [here](https://github.com/Remes92/BachelorProjectClient) and database data generator used [here](https://github.com/Oldalf/dataBaseSamplePopulator). Databases with data used exist in the folders MongoDb_data and MySqlDb_data (test has 10 rows in each table and empty is just the database schema while the last one has all of the data used in the benchmark)
